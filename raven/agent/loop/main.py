        onto the single ``emit``, return a TurnOutcome. Collapses the legacy
        output paths (a str return + the five callbacks) onto one boundary.

        Named ``run_turn`` rather than ``run``: ``run`` is the runtime keep-alive
        (executor / debug server / MCP up, then idle). A spine runner wraps this
        method to satisfy the TurnRunner protocol.

        ``stream`` is the canon Q2-D assembly switch: a streaming outlet (TUI)
        wires it True so the reply goes out as StreamDelta and dissolves (b2 — no
        trailing Text); a non-streaming outlet (REPL) wires it False so the reply
        is one Text. It gates both LLM callbacks (the loop streams when either is
        wired) and the message-tool routing, so the whole reply travels one way.

        Exceptions propagate so the lane turns them into TurnFailed — run_turn
        does not catch sandbox-init to return an error string (the legacy direct
        path did; the spine surfaces it as a TurnFailed event instead).

        ``usage_sink`` lets a caller observe the turn's full token accounting
        (cost / context, richer than the three-field TurnOutcome.usage): pass a
        dict and it is filled. The TUI passes one to attach the rich usage to
        message.complete; the REPL omits it and uses TurnOutcome.usage.

        ``text_sink`` is its sibling for the reply text: pass a dict and the
        final reply lands in text_sink["text"] (the reply still goes out via
        emit — this is an observation copy, not a second delivery). cron passes
        one so its system event can tell the heartbeat what the run produced.
        Both sinks are transitional, to retire together when taps lands (a
        read-only observer of the turn's output).

        ``drain`` pulls user messages injected mid-turn (BusyPolicy.INJECT); it
        is threaded into the agent loop and consumed at the top of each iteration.
